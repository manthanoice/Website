# Website
It is just simple website which I made as mini project for 2nd semester at the university

## CSS and HTML

Every HTML and CSS file I made is available inside web xD folder

I haven't added js because I don't yet have much knowledge about it but hopefully soon! xD

It's not that much of big or amazing project. It is totally basic website which I made to understand web development a little and you can say it was first step haha, made it 6 months ago.

## One snapshot of website
